## <b>Running Pulsehax</b>
1. Either download and extract the [PulseHax.zip](PulseHax0.5.1.zip) archive, or clone the repository.  

1. In order to add PulseHax to Chrome, navigate to your Chrome settings, then select "Extensions" from the left hand side bar, and enable "Developer mode" in the upper right hand corner.

1. Finally, select "Load unpacked" from the upper left selections, and navigate to the PulseHax directory when prompted. And you're done!

Eventually, I would like to list this privately on the Chrome Web Store to further ease installation, but there is a $5 fee to create a developer account that just isn't worth paying for the 5 total users I expect. 

## <b>Terms Of Service</b>
By downloading PulseHax, you agree to the following terms of service:

You won't use my tools to do bad things. Over the development process we've added many safeguards to prevent misuse but the TOS make misuse completely impossible since noone would eeeeever lie.

If people ask about any of the functions of PulseHax, refer them here. This entire project was designed as a means of sharing information and expanding the scope of Gamma modifications.

Don't repackage my code and sell it. No one will buy it anyway. If you want to otherwise repackage and modify the code ask me and the answer will always be yes.
