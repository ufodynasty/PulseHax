# PulseHax

***Hacking Pulsus has never been so easy***

## Introduction

PulseHax is a Pulsus extension that adds a lot of QoL features not yet added to the base game, such as custom themes, plugins, and a lot of really useful editor features! The extension currently is only fully supported on **Chromium-based browsers**, with some limited support on FireFox, although we plan on getting this working for all you client folks in the near future. (Not for other browsers though, that'd be too much work \:P)

## Features

- **Copy, export and import** maps of your choice for personal use, sharing or editing!
- **Sync your settings across browsers** using PulseHax's Settings Imports!
- **Use fully customizable themes** with our brand new Custom Theme editor, now with previews!
- **Automatically apply your own preferred foresight** to maps (No math required)!
- **Skip long, boring intros of maps** using PulseHax's Skip Intro!
- Use PulseHax's fully fledged **Custom Editor** with plenty of features to choose from, such as **Custom Selecting**, **Custom Snaps**, **Playback Rates**, and **Color Banks**!
- Move notes between maps with our **Buffers**!
- Create your own **practice difficulties** of maps!
...And much, much more to come!

## Running PulseHax

### Through GitHub

1. [Download the latest version of PulseHax in our releases](https://github.com/ufodynasty/PulseHax/releases/latest), and then extract the ZIP file.

1. **Navigate to your Chrome Extensions** tab, and make sure you have "Developer Mode" enabled at the top right portion of the page.

1. Finally, select **"Load unpacked"** from the upper left selections, and navigate to the PulseHax folder when prompted. And you're done!

### Through Chrome Webstore

The Chrome Webstore version is preferred if you don't like manually updating the file every Pulsus update, but be reminded the GitHub version will always be the most up-to-date one as Chrome needs to get the extension through a security check before releasing it.
You can download the Webstore version of PulseHax [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pulsehax/fdcmeokmcaclcbnjdmmmgdempikgnjmn), and you should be good to go! Just enable it and from there you won't need to do anything.
> If Pulsus gets updated and we haven't fixed PulseHax yet, it is recommend to **temporarily disable the extension** until we do as not doing so can result in PulseHax running code that could, for example, permanently damage your local storage, which could mean *losing your local maps*, or in some extreme cases, making the game completely unusable until your cache is cleared, because of how Pulsus is minified and could very well get certain functions swapped.

## Terms of Service

By downloading PulseHax, you agree to the following terms of service:

- You won't use my tools to do bad things. Over the development process we've added many safeguards to prevent misuse but the TOS make misuse completely impossible since no one would eeeeever lie.
- If people ask about any of the functions of PulseHax, refer them here. This entire project was designed as a means of sharing information and expanding the scope of Gamma modifications.
- Don't repackage my code and sell it. No one will buy it anyway. If you want to otherwise repackage and modify the code, ask me and the answer will always be yes.

## Pulsus Terms of Service for Third-Party Modifications

- Modifying an awarded map will get the map unawarded with no possibility of being reawarded.
- Having any third-party modifications installed/enabled (even if not in use) while playing awarded maps can put your account at risk of being banned. If you are using a Chrome extension, you have the option to disable it through the Extensions bar. Please make sure to reload the page after enabling/disabling any extensions to make sure they have been fully activated/deactivated.
- Uploading maps or making changes to your account page that could not be normally done outside of the use of third-party modifications could put your account at risk of an upload ban, which would no longer allow you to upload new maps to the server. This does not prevent their use for QoL changes to the editor though, such as tools or exporting functionality.
