## <b>Running Pulsehax</b>
1. Clone the repository. If you are unfamiliar with git, click the green CODE button in the upper right, then select download zip, and finally extract all files. 

1. In order to add PulseHax to Chrome, navigate to your Chrome settings, then select "Extensions" from the left hand side bar, and enable "Developer mode" in the upper right hand corner.

1. Finally, select "Load unpacked" from the upper left selections, and navigate to the PulseHax directory when prompted. And you're done!

Eventually, I would like to list this privately on the Chrome Web Store to further ease installation, but there is a $5 fee to create a developer account that just isn't worth paying for the 5 total users I expect. 

## <b>Terms Of Service</b>
By downloading PulseHax, you agree to the following terms of service:

- You won't use my tools to do bad things. Over the development process we've added many safeguards to prevent misuse but the TOS make misuse completely impossible since no one would eeeeever lie.
- If people ask about any of the functions of PulseHax, refer them here. This entire project was designed as a means of sharing information and expanding the scope of Gamma modifications.
- Don't repackage my code and sell it. No one will buy it anyway. If you want to otherwise repackage and modify the code ask me and the answer will always be yes.

## <b>Pulsus Terms of Service for Third-Party Modifications</b>
- Modifying an awarded level will get the level unawarded with no possibility of being reawarded
- Having any third-party modifications installed/enabled (even if not in use) while playing awarded levels can put your account at risk of being banned. If you are using a chrome extension, you have the option to disable it through the extensions bar. Please make sure to reload the page after enabling/disabling any extensions to make sure they have been fully activated/deactivated.
- Uploading levels or making changes to your account page that could not be normally done outside of the use of third-party modifications could put your account at risk of an upload ban, which would no longer allow you to upload new levels to the server. This does not prevent their use for QOL changes to the editor though, such as tools or exporting functionality.
